# The Student / High School Admission Problem (SAP)
An instance of SAP involves a set of students and a set of high schools, each student seeking admission to one school, and each school having a number of available places (its capacity). Each student ranks some (acceptable) schools in strict order, and each school ranks its applicants in some order. A matching is a set of pairs (student, school) such that each student is assigned to at most one school and the capacities of the schools are not exceeded. A matching is stable if there is no pair (s, h) such that s is assigned to h' but s prefers h better than h' and h prefers s better than some of its assigned students. We consider the problem of creating a stable matching between students and schools.
